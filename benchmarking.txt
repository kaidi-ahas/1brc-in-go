1st version:
took:  1m6.068239792s

real    1m6.091s actual wall-clock time
user    1m16.681s time spent executing the Go code (CPU time)
sys     0m4.047s time spent in OS calls (file i/o, syscalls)

the program:
Finished 1B rows in ~66 seconds.
Used 76 seconds of CPU time.
    - used more than one core
    - CPU bound, which means that the program is limited by computation:
        - string splitting
        - float parsing
        - hashing station names
        - map updates
Only 4 seconds in system calls.
    - not IO bound
    - disk is not the bottleneck
